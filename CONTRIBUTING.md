## Contribute To Nwicode

Anyone can contribute to Nwicode. And we need your contributions.


## Share new features

If you have developed, who are aiming to develop new features to share with the SiberianCMS community you are welcome.

We wrote a [complete documentation](https://github.com/nwicode/nwicode_api/) on how to create new `modules`

## Pull Request

Keep your pull requests as small as possible, bundle only one feature or bug fix per pull request, it is also easier for us to test single bug fixes

## Conventions

We try to follow the PSR-1 standard as much as possible, and to keep our code clear and understandable, that's all !

* Comment every portion of code you think could be hard to understand.
